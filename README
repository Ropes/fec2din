This is a small bash script (which wraps a small awk script) to provide human-readable out for ec2-describe-instances (ec2din). fec2din can be run with no arguments, or by passing in ec2-describe-instances ouput to stdin. Simply named "f" + "ec2din", the command can easily be run after viewing the horrific ec2din output by simply typing "f!!" in a modern shell.

This script requires ec2-describe-instances to be properly set up with exported environment variables and has been tested against ec2-api-tools version 1.4.4.3.

Example:
$ ec2din
